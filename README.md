# phema-execution-ui

This code was created using Eclipse Juno and attempts were made to keep it e4 compliant.

Issues arose when working with the editor viewers.  Went to SWT to get it working, but then tried to switch back.  
The initial commit of the code fails when opening file due to the partial switch back to e4.
